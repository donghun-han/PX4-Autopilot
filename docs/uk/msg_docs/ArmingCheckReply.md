# ArmingCheckReply (повідомлення UORB)

Arming check reply.

This is a response to an ArmingCheckRequest message sent by the FMU to an external component, such as a ROS 2 navigation mode.
The response contains the current set of external mode requirements, and a queue of events indicating recent failures to set the mode (which the FMU may then forward to a ground station).
The request is sent regularly to all registered ROS modes, even while armed, so that the FMU always knows and can forward the current state.

Note that the external component is identified by its registration_id, which is allocated to the component during registration (arming_check_id in RegisterExtComponentReply).
The message is not used by internal/FMU components, as their mode requirements are known at compile time.
